# gh-score

As it only took around 20 min to craft python version, I decided to try how it might be done in bash, so decided to spend another 15 minutes for that.

Things that might be improved:
1) Error handling/negative scanarios
2) GH user parametrization - e.g. taking it from script input arguments

No tests or integration gates are added, as this seems to be too simple and utility script.

I intentionally created this code the way I would do if I got this kind of a task in real life - this is just a simple tool that solves some simple problem.
So the cost to automate it should be minimal and the main focus is on the happy path with minimal time spent on development.
